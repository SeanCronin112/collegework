Some things to note:


For the video presentation (and for testing), I left in the tkinter code from the following tutorial: https://medium.com/python-in-plain-english/build-a-chatroom-app-with-python-458fc435025a
This is not intended to be considered an extra feature. It is not my work, and I am using it to demonstrate in the video.

I also feel like it's worth mentioning that my code is inspired by the code in that tutorial.

The tutorial also has another thread running to take input for server commands, which are listed in the file.
